are
not
as
beautiful

as
they

people
shine
not
by
the
clothes
they
"wear,"
or
the
way
they
comb
their
hair.

beauty
is
more
than
skin
"deep,"
it's
in
the
kindness
that
they
keep.
""
in
every
"smile,"
in
every
"tear,"
in
moments
of
joy
and
when
they
"fear,"
people
are
beautiful
when
they
are
"true,"
when
they
dare
to
be
vulnerable
too.
""
so
look
beyond
the
surface
and
"see,"
the
beauty
in
"you,"
the
beauty
in
me.
for
we
are
all
beautiful
in
our
unique
"way,"
as
we
"live,"
as
we
"laugh,"
as
we
pray.
